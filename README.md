# NBAFanHotspotsProject

# Overview
This repository contains the code and resources for a data analysis project aimed at identifying high-potential geographic areas for NBA fan engagement and revenue growth. The project leverages demographic, economic, and fan concentration data to classify zip codes into opportunity levels, helping the NBA target its campaigns more effectively.

# Project Description
The project uses a combination of data preprocessing, visualization, and machine learning (K-Nearest Neighbors classifier) to analyze various zip codes across the United States. It identifies "High Opportunity" areas where the NBA can focus its marketing efforts to attract new fans and boost revenue.

# Data Sources
NBA Fans by Zip Code: A dataset containing NBA fan concentration data by zip code.
NBA Team Zip Codes: A dataset listing zip codes associated with NBA teams.

# Results
The analysis results include:
Optimal K-value for the KNN classifier.
Visualization of fan concentration, household income, and demographic factors.
List of high-potential zip codes for NBA fan engagement.
